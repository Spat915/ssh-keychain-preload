# SSH KEYCHAIN PRELOAD

## Usage:

1. Clone and copy .bashrc into your home directory. On Linux-based systems, that's `~/`. On Windows systems, that's `C:\Users\<Username>\`.
2. Edit the file to change the `/w/path...` entries at the top to the path(s) to your ssh keys. You can put as many or as few keys as you like here. The script comes with 2 instances outlined.
3. Start a bash shell (might need to re-source the file in Linux). The bashrc should automatically attempt to load the ssh keys you defined.
   - If the keys need passwords, you will be prompted for them before the shell allows you to type other commands.

## Notes:
On windows, the ssh-agent runs as a service, so you only need to re-enter your ssh passwords if you a) kill the service, or b) reboot.

The keys to add to the keychain should have been generated by the ssh-keygen command. Keys generated elsewhere might not work (PuTTY ppk keys for instance).

The paths in bashrc should be to your private keys, not the public counterparts.
